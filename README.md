# k-connectivity
Repository for a software technology project about k-connectivity.

# About the code
The project is split into four packages, each containing the implementation of an algorithm as specified in the report. The code is commented such that a reader familiar with the algoritms should be able to understand the code from the comments. 

The workload was distributed as follows, see more in the comments of the file:

- TwoEdgeHighpoint: Niels, Gad
- TwoEdgeChains: Magnus
- ThreeEdge: Gad
- FourEdge: Niels (Magnus MPF and UnionFind)

All "correctness"-tests were done by Anders Reher.

# Testing
The following python packages are need to be able to run the code for generating pdf's with linear-regression models and plot of the data.
- statsmodels
- seaborn
These packages can be installed by executing the following two commands in the terminal:
- pip install statsmodels
- pip install seaborn
